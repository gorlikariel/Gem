A progressive web app used to remind and track birth control pill usage,
because birth control is no joke.

## Introduction

I started teaching myself React about 6 months ago,
and Gem is my first project.
I love every second of writing it, and I hope it
to be one of many in the future.

## Built With

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - (Still learning)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - The web framework used
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - State Management
- [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/core/guides/philosophy) - Routing
- [Material-ui](https://material-ui.com/) - Design system
- [Zeplin](https://zeplin.io/) - Styleguide & Screens
- [Wakatime](https://wakatime.com/) - Programming Metrics and Tracking
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - Development Platform
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) - Javascript and React Testing
- [Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/) - Javascript and React Testing

The project is still being built, and features are regularly added.

For styling I used a mix of material-ui and my own code, and is
written completely with css-in-js. no CSS files were used.
Gem is supposed to feel like a native app, and I'm thinking
about also writing it in React Native in the future.

## The Vision

I wanted to make it easy to manage birth control pills, and to avoid situations where the user isn't
sure about whether she took the pill today or not, or how many pills are left in her
pack when it's not on her right now.
Forgetting the pill just sucks, and Gem does its best to keep you from forgetting,
by sending you a push notification at the time you set it to, and triggering the alarm
clock.
